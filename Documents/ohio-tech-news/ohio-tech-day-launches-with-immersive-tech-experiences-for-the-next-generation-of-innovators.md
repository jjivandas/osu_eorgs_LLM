Ohio Tech Day 2024 officially kicked off at C-TEC of Licking County on
Wednesday with an event designed to inspire students and educators to explore
future career opportunities in tech and skilled trades.

The statewide launch event, organized by OhioX, Meta’s New Albany Data Center,
at C-TEC marked the first Ohio visit from the Be Pro Be Proud Mobile Workshop,
a national nonprofit that provides hands-on experiences with cutting-edge
technology and trade skills. This collaboration highlights Ohio’s commitment
to preparing its students for tech-driven careers in a rapidly evolving
economy.

Attendees, including students, community leaders, and educators, were immersed
in a range of virtual reality (VR) experiences showcasing high-demand careers
in fields such as welding, HVAC, robotics, and electrical work. Using Meta
Quest VR headsets, students explored tech-driven skilled trades, bridging the
gap between traditional craftsmanship and new-age technology. The interactive
demos allowed students to experience what it’s like to work in industries
critical to Ohio’s innovation economy.

Ohio Tech Day isn’t just about celebrating technology—it’s about creating
pathways for the next generation of Ohio innovators. By providing students
with hands-on experiences in both tech and skilled trades, Ohio’s tech
industry and education partners are actively shaping the workforce of
tomorrow, making sure young talent stays in the state and fuels its growing
innovation economy.

### Why this matters to Ohio

As Ohio continues to establish itself as a leader in tech and innovation,
initiatives like Ohio Tech Day aim to create excitement around career pathways
in technology and skilled trades. Chris Berry, President and CEO of OhioX,
emphasized the importance of industry-education partnerships, stating, “We
can’t build the Silicon Heartland without the talented technology
professionals that will make it happen.”

Be Pro Be Proud, which has operations in states across America, made its Ohio
debut at this launch event. In collaboration with Meta, the Mobile Workshop
brought high-tech, hands-on experiences directly to students, offering them a
unique opportunity to discover careers that blend innovation and skilled
craftsmanship.

### What they’re saying

  * Joyce L. Malainy, Superintendent of C-TEC, highlighted the importance of skilled workforce development, expressing excitement about the collaboration: “C-TEC has been in the business of career technical education and career development for over 50 years... We are thrilled to partner with OhioX, Meta’s New Albany Data Center, and Be Pro Be Proud to promote “Ohio Tech Day”, and especially proud to be selected as the first Ohio School to host the Be Pro Be Proud mobile workforce workshop.”

  * Tara Tenorio, Meta’s Community Development Regional Manager, praised the initiative’s potential to inspire the next generation: ““Skilled trade professionals are critical to building and operating Meta\'s global fleet of data centers, including our New Albany Data Center. We are excited to introduce a new generation of Ohio students to these in-demand careers through the use of our Meta Quest headsets and other virtual reality technologies in partnership with Be Pro Be Proud.”

  * Andrew Parker, Be Pro Be Proud’s Executive Director added, “The hands-on technical career exploration we provide students helps broaden student awareness of many high-tech, high-wage technical professions that, if pursued, will position them to be part of the next generation of fortune creators. We hope this is the beginning of a shared success story that builds Ohio’s workforce.”

### What’s next for Ohio Tech Day

This launch event is just the beginning. The statewide Ohio Tech Day
celebrations will continue on Friday, September 27th, with schools, companies,
and nonprofits hosting events, programs, and learning focused on students and
tech-career exploration. With Meta as the presenting sponsor, Ohio Tech Day
seeks to inspire students across the state to pursue careers in technology and
innovation.
